BSDGo is a modern iOS application designed to enhance the daily commuting experience for BSD Link users. Inspired by the OneSmile BSD Link design, BSDGo brings thoughtful improvements in usability, speed, and convenience—tailored specifically for the needs of BSD commuters.

With a refined interface and user-friendly features, SwiftRide helps users make smarter transportation decisions—whether to take the BSD Link or explore alternative options. One standout feature is the integrated Widget, which allows users to instantly view information about the nearest bus stops without even opening the app. This makes it easier than ever to assess proximity and plan commutes on the go—especially when stops are out of reach.

BSDGo elevates the standard commuting experience with a clean design, real-time insights, and seamless iOS integration—making daily travel in BSD smarter, faster, and more intuitive.
